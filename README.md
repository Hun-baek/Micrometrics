# OSE data science final project | Jonghun Baek | Summersemester 2021

My project is based on Alesina, Alberto, and Ekaterina Zhuravskaya. 2011. ["Segregation and the Quality of Government in a Cross Section of Countries."](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.5.1872) American Economic Review, 101 (5): 1872-1911.

Alesina and Zhuravskaya (2011) examine how three dimensions of segregation (ethnicity, language, and religion) negatively affect the governmental quality using 2SLS regression. They analyze it with the data set collected worldwide. Mathematical formulas are produced to evaluate the segregation level of each country. World Bank's Governance indicators are introduced to evaluate the governmental quality as dependent variables. Ethnic and linguistic segregation except for religion has a significantly negative effect on the governance indicators. "Trust" is identified as a channel between them. Moreover, their additional goals are also achieved. One of them is to distribute the segregation level data based on the world level. The other one is to show segregation is an influencing factor to determine the governmental quality rather than fractionalization.
